# SAS Sports — Current Session and School-Module Handoff

Last updated: September 27, 2026, America/Chicago.

**Read this current file at the beginning of every SAS Sports session.** This is the canonical working handoff. Update this same path at each session boundary and append the new session record below. Do not replace current facts with older conversation summaries.

## Current state

The K-State school module is implemented and locally validated on `refactor/kstate-school-module-20260927`, based on main `3ed968bda3ecef6bf6003b0663456e2beab7d383`. Candidate version: **4.25.0-kstate-module**. Publication status will be recorded in the September 27 session entry below. **The module has not been merged or deployed.** The last verified live version remains the September 26 cross-country correction recorded in the table below.

See `docs/KSTATE_MODULE.md` for the ownership inventory and test contract. K-State's existing school-specific backend policies are now in `src/schools/kstate.mjs`; generic publisher logic and shared catalog/display metadata remain shared.

The baseline branch is a named recovery checkpoint. Do not move it during normal development. Documentation commits after this application commit do not represent additional application changes. Use the current main branch for new work, retaining this exact application commit as the comparison/recovery reference.

## What was fixed and why it mattered

The September 4 Platte River Rumble Gold event had a saved, exact-event table built from the official recap. Its reliable results were not dependent on live AI generation.

For September 25 Gans Creek, the live feed selected only the women's result PDF, returning nine women and marking the result verified. The expanded view used a separate prose parser that could overwrite those rows with incorrect results. One observed response contained an incorrect men's team win and an athlete named `Junior Brock`; AI returned `ai_failed`. Generic TFRRS enrichment could also replace the original race's good table with malformed group labels and `0th` DNF/DNS rows.

The deployed K-State-only fix reads the exact official recap's labeled women's and men's team-finishes and individual-results sections. It extracts division/distance, K-State team placing/points, and each published athlete/place/time. Both the feed and expanded view use that same result path. Complete recap rows cannot be overwritten by a single PDF or AI/prose extraction. Incomplete or unavailable sections are explicitly marked partial. A matching future recap does not require a new hand-entered race record.

Official recap sources:

- https://www.kstatesports.com/news/2026/9/25/cross-country-wildcats-showcase-significant-personal-improvement-at-gans-creek-classic
- https://www.kstatesports.com/news/2026/9/4/cross-country-k-state-clinches-team-wins-at-platte-river-rumble-gold

### Verified live results

| School / event | Women | Men | Team rows | Total rows |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| K-State — Gans Creek | 9 | 7 | 2 | 18 |
| K-State — Platte River Rumble Gold | 11 | 7 | 2 | 20 |

Gans Creek: women 18th / 499 points; men 17th / 449 points. The expanded live page displayed every runner, including the final listed women and men, with the expected names, places and times. Platte River's expanded live page retained the complete original table and highlights.

KU's live feed after this deployment retained 26 Gans Creek rows and 21 Bob Timmons rows. This is a scoped K-State/KU verification, not a claim that every sport at every school is currently correct.

### Validation completed

- `npm run test:release` passed.
- `npm test` passed.
- `git diff --check` passed.
- Offline esbuild Worker bundle passed.
- Wrangler deployment dry-run passed after user approval.
- Actual downloaded K-State schedule/recap processed through production `fetchLive` and expanded-event code: 18/20 rows and matching feed/modal results.
- GitHub PR guardrails and certification-matrix jobs passed before merge (workflow run `36276099363`). Live-school jobs intentionally skipped for this PR.
- Remote correction tree matched the tested local tree exactly.
- Production status confirmed `4.24.1-kstate-recap-results`.
- Browser verification opened both K-State races and checked full result text and layout after deployment.
- Local regression protections covered the original K-State record, KU records, school/date identity, later matching recaps, incomplete/failed sources, 18 certified schools and 71 school/sport cache identities.

## School-module direction agreed with the user

The app should have one module per school, with sport handlers inside each school module as needed. School-specific source selection, schedule parsing, recap extraction and athlete verification belong there. Shared display, selection, refresh, caching and standardized event/result structures remain shared.

Separate files alone do not guarantee isolation. Test each module against that school's real publisher formats, and test shared changes against verified schools. Keep complete men's/women's result sections and source links in a consistent result format.

Agreed sequence:

1. **Completed:** preserve today's working version as the baseline.
2. **Implemented and locally validated:** K-State module extraction; merge/deployment and live verification remain pending.
3. A separate later session: bring KU's existing cross-country adapter into the school-module structure.
4. Correct and verify each remaining school individually, one school per new session.

The September 26 “Do the first one” applied to baseline preservation. The separate September 27 “Start KSTATE module” request authorized the extraction now prepared on its own branch.

## Instructions for the next session

1. Read this file from the current GitHub main branch before beginning. Root `AGENTS.md` also directs this.
2. Check current main, application version and local changes. Reconcile any changes since this handoff without silently reverting them.
3. Resume the K-State module branch/PR before starting another school. Confirm its current merge/deployment status. The code is implemented; do not repeat the extraction.
4. Review `src/schools/kstate.mjs` and `docs/KSTATE_MODULE.md`. The shared Worker imports the module's schedule overrides, verified socials and soccer facts, and creates its cross-country handlers with shared helpers.
5. Run `npm run test:release` if code changes, preserving `tests/kstate-cross-country.mjs`, `tests/kstate-module.mjs`, the frozen baseline fixture and KU tests. The 18/20 cross-country result rows are mandatory.
6. Merge/deploy only with applicable user authorization, then verify candidate version `4.25.0-kstate-module` and open both live K-State expanded results. Current local evidence is not a deployed verification.
7. After K-State is merged and live-verified, update this file and make KU the next separate school-module session. Preserve earlier session records.

Do not automatically broaden work to all schools. Do not claim future publisher changes are fully supported: the current K-State parser depends on its labeled recap-result sections and reports partial results when those cannot be loaded.

## Publication and permission history

Automatic review initially blocked a Cloudflare dry-run and a GitHub push pending explicit publication approval. The user then approved pushing the fix to `egassam/SAS-Sports`, merging it, and deploying to the existing Cloudflare app. Publication and deployment subsequently succeeded.

Shell `git push` had no GitHub credentials. The connected GitHub tools successfully created the exact tested tree, commit, branch and PR. PR #11 was merged after checks passed. Cloudflare's existing GitHub integration deployed it; no separate direct deployment was needed.

The earlier `docs/KSTATE_CROSS_COUNTRY_CHECKPOINT.md` records pre-approval blockers. This current handoff supersedes that document's publication status. Prior approval was for the completed correction; it is not blanket authorization for unrelated future actions.

## Session conversation — September 26, 2026

This record preserves the user messages and substantive final assistant replies visible in this session. Progress/tool activity is summarized afterward; this is not a raw tool-log export or a reconstruction of earlier sessions.

### User — reported regression

> Now KSTATE cross country isn't working correctly. Only women show up in the new race.
> Figure out why everything works perfectly in the first KSTATE cross country event and repeat it. I believe you used AI to go into the official recap to get the results for our results page

### Assistant — diagnosis, implementation and approval request

I found the cause and fixed the code, **but it isn’t live yet**.

The first race uses a complete saved table from its official recap. The new race was reading only the women’s PDF; opening it then triggered another parser that produced incorrect results.

The fix reads both labeled sections directly from the recap, producing **nine women, seven men, and both team scores** in the first race’s format. Tests pass, including protection for the original event and KU.

Automatic approval review blocked both GitHub publication and the Cloudflare check because they send code externally.

**Approve pushing this fix to `egassam/SAS-Sports`, merging it, and deploying to your existing Cloudflare app?** I’ll then verify the live results page.

### User — approval

> Approve

### Assistant — verified completion

**Fixed and live.** I verified both expanded K-State results pages:

- **Gans Creek:** all nine women, seven men, and both team scores.
- **First race:** all 20 original result rows preserved.

[Open SAS Sports](https://sas-sports.lovetogivepain.workers.dev/?school=kstate) and tap **Refresh**.

A screenshot of the live results was included in the reply. Saved filename: `SAS_Sports_KState_Verified_Results_20260926.jpg`.

### User — school-module proposal

> This looks great now to me I think moving forward we should make corrections to each school making each school a single module? What do you think?

### Assistant — recommended architecture and sequence

**Yes. Each school should have its own module, with a shared core keeping SAS Sports consistent.** That would make school-specific corrections easier to contain and test.

I’d organize it this way:

| Part | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| **School module** | Official sources, schedule formats, recap extraction, and athlete verification for that school |
| **Sport handlers within it** | Cross-country tables, football scores, tennis results, and other sport-specific differences |
| **Shared core** | Display, school selection, refreshing, caching, and a standard results format |

Every school would deliver the same structured information to the app. For cross country, that means clearly labeled divisions, team scores, athlete names, places, times, and source links.

**Moving code into separate files alone won’t prevent regressions.** Each module also needs tests using that school’s actual official pages, plus checks that shared changes preserve working schools.

I recommend this sequence:

1. Preserve today’s working version as the baseline.
2. Move K-State’s working logic into its school module and verify identical output.
3. Bring KU’s existing cross-country module into that structure.
4. Correct and verify each remaining school individually.

That gives us a repeatable process: **fix one school, verify its results in the live app, then move on.**

### User — save baseline, conversation and session workflow

> Do the first one them we will saving the conversation into a .md file, then end this session. We will start a new session for each school module going forward. Each new session I want you to read the current .md file to begin the new section.

### Assistant — scope confirmation and completed handoff

The assistant explained that “the first one” means preserving today's working baseline, then saving this conversation and a current handoff file. A repository startup instruction was added to read this file before each future school-module session. No module migration was started.

### Progress and tool activity summary

The current repository, merged KU work, live feed, expanded-result API, and K-State's official recap pages were inspected. The women's-only feed and incorrect expanded results were reproduced. The scoped fix and meaningful regression tests were written and tested against actual source HTML. After approval, the exact tested tree was published through GitHub, merged, and deployed by the existing Cloudflare integration. Both K-State races were opened in the live browser; KU's feed was checked for preservation. The working application commit was then preserved on a named checkpoint branch, and this current handoff plus root startup instructions were saved. Application code was unchanged during the final baseline/documentation step.

## Future session records

Append each new school-module session here. Keep the current-state and next-session sections above accurate so the next session can begin without reconstructing the entire history.


### September 27, 2026 — save verification and completion

The user asked, "Did you finish before I ran out of usage?" The assistant initially could not verify the handoff save from conversation history. The user then instructed, "Confirm saving."

Direct GitHub inspection confirmed the recovery branch checkpoint/kstate-xc-verified-20260926 exists at 19ec2ecb2ac03b8c7d242cb14a23146878857ab0. The handoff and startup instructions existed in local documentation commit 9735515 but were absent from GitHub main. This session publishes those documentation files to finish the authorized save. The earlier wording that the handoff was saved referred to the local copy; the GitHub save was outstanding.

Scope clarification: the requested "first one" in the September 26 sequence was preserving the working baseline, which was completed. School-module migration was deliberately deferred to the next session. K-State remains the next module. This session changes documentation only; no new application tests or live verification were performed. The September 26 results above retain their original verification date.


### September 27, 2026 — K-State module implementation

User: “Start KSTATE module.” Earlier in the thread the user ended the save session; no module changes had been made at that point. This request begins the actual module implementation.

The current GitHub handoff and AGENTS.md were read before work. Main was fetched at `3ed968bda3ecef6bf6003b0663456e2beab7d383`; an isolated worktree/branch was created from that commit. The previous application baseline passed the release suite before extraction.

Implemented `src/schools/kstate.mjs`: six schedule overrides, three verified tennis identities, institutional social exclusion, five saved soccer recaps, original meet snapshot/highlights, and all K-State cross-country guards/parser/completeness/enrichment. Common publisher helpers, cache behavior, UI and shared metadata remain in their existing owners. Existing test harnesses now inject the real module. Added a permanent module test and frozen pre-refactor baseline fixture. Candidate version is `4.25.0-kstate-module`.

Validation actually completed:
- `npm run test:release` passed, including 18 protected schools and 71 critical school/sport cache identities, KU and K-State cross-country checks, and the new module test.
- `npm test` passed, including roster social identity checks.
- All ten K-State schedule/roster route outputs, five soccer enrichments and three verified tennis identities passed baseline checks; the tennis accounts were tested through the featured-athlete function with a deterministic roster fixture.
- Before/after comparison preserved 218 catalog school/sport schedule and roster route combinations and all saved game/social/source maps.
- Saved official K-State schedule/recap HTML replayed through production fetchLive and expanded results produced matching outputs (ignoring execution timestamps), including 18 Gans Creek rows and 20 Platte River rows.
- Offline esbuild bundle and actual bundled Worker import plus `/api/status` passed. Initial bundling used an older dependency directory missing unpdf; selecting the previous K-State checkout's complete installed dependencies resolved it without source/dependency changes.
- `git diff --check` passed.

Limitations and remaining tasks: no new live per-sport certification, browser verification, merge or deployment has been performed for this candidate. The recap parser still requires the official labeled sections and reports incomplete results explicitly. Complete K-State publication/live verification before moving to KU in a later session.
