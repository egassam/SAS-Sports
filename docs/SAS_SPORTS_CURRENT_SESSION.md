# SAS Sports — Current Session and School-Module Handoff

Last updated: September 29, 2026, America/Chicago.

**Read this current file at the beginning of every SAS Sports session.** This is the canonical working handoff. Update this same path at each session boundary and append the new session record below. Do not replace current facts with older conversation summaries.

## Current state

**Oklahoma State module is merged, deployed and live as `4.29.0-oklahoma-state-module`.** The user merged PR #21 (https://github.com/egassam/SAS-Sports/pull/21) at 17:31 UTC on September 29 as merge commit `da5b91efa3647fed90dc0a1ef247db89f4d05992`. Production verification is recorded under "Oklahoma State production verification" below. See `docs/OKLAHOMA_STATE_MODULE.md`. Oklahoma State's athlete-certification failure was a validator rule, not an app defect. It is fixed by the new opt-in `athlete_profile_fallback_sports` certification field, which affects only Oklahoma State. Verified schools are now K-State, KU and Oklahoma State. Utah and Alabama still fail athlete checks unchanged.

**Project scope (user, September 29): only K-State and KU are expected to work correctly now.** Every other school still needs its own school module built the same way as `src/schools/kstate.mjs` and `src/schools/kansas.mjs`, one school per session, with tests against that school's real official sources. Until a school is converted, its live-certification failures are expected. They are not regressions and not a reason to patch that school inside shared code. As of this date, Oklahoma State, Utah and Alabama fail athlete-Instagram checks, and the other 13 non-module schools pass only the basic certification checks.

**The September 29 local-time fix is merged, deployed and live as `4.28.1-local-time`.** PR #19 merged at 15:25 UTC as `79c157d8ce8349439cab3c23931d46f5fb920682`, and production switched at about 15:29 UTC.

Official schedule times are stored as the school's local wall clock, while ESPN times are true UTC and "today" was computed in UTC. So a 7 PM Central K-State game failed to reconcile with its ESPN score, appeared as a separate next-day Live card, and dropped out of Upcoming at 00:00 UTC. The fix adds a per-school time zone (a state map plus a Tennessee override). It converts ESPN times into that frame and uses the school's local date in the shared `makeEvent`, `groupEvents` and text-row checks and in the KU module.

An actual evening game has not yet been observed through the fix; deterministic fixtures cover it.

**K-State live display preview is deployed.** PR #18 corrected the initial PR #17 preview after the user selected Football and saw an empty Live tab. The opt-in URL `https://sas-sports.lovetogivepain.workers.dev/?school=kstate&demo=live` now opens on Football + Live with a persistent, clearly labeled 28–21 sample and supports Basketball's 71–68 sample when selected. The button moves the example through Final, Upcoming, and Live while selecting the corresponding tab. The regular app and feed API retain genuine data only. This demonstrates display states, not a real in-progress ESPN game. September 29 forced Football and Basketball production feeds had no live K-State contest.

**The September 28 K-State dual-team and live-score work is complete, merged, deployed, and live as `4.28.0-kstate-live-scores`.** PR #15 added explicit men’s and women’s K-State Golf sources and labels while preserving both Basketball teams. Production Golf verification returned both divisions, 4 results and 22 upcoming events. PR #16 added independent ESPN scoreboard inputs for K-State Football and both Basketball programs, merged at application commit `a23a16b3b1d2a5fafec5327041953fcb4b672d43`. The scoreboards run alongside the official K-State schedules, reconcile on sport/date/division, and can supply a game even when the school schedule has no usable live state. Production returned the new version and healthy current Football/Basketball feeds; no K-State game was in progress at verification time, so an actual live-game transition was not observable. Historical live payload fixtures verify score, clock/period, final state, team identity, and men’s/women’s isolation.

**KU module is complete, merged, deployed, and live as `4.26.1-kansas-recap`.** PR #14 merged at 13:54:46 America/Chicago on September 28, producing `c9a02452107bad023ff06214f4ba99668f06d5a4`. Post-merge certification run `36468538013` passed. Production status and the exact South Dakota State volleyball event were rechecked after deployment: the card now uses the correct September 11 KU recap and its expanded endpoint returns four verified event-specific highlights. The broader KU verification below remains accurate, with the documented tennis, softball, and track source limitations. KU is finished; do not begin another school until the user starts a new school-module session.


**K-State module extraction is complete, merged and live as `4.25.0-kstate-module`.** [PR #12](https://github.com/egassam/SAS-Sports/pull/12) was merged after user approval on September 27 at 14:50:17 UTC (09:50:17 America/Chicago), producing application commit `30d6edd0f46f1ceebaed1fd7f5eca54921f0f095`. This completion session verified the production version and opened both expanded cross-country races in the live app. Gans Creek retains 18 rows (9 women, 7 men, 2 teams); Platte River retains 20 rows (11 women, 7 men, 2 teams). KU is being completed in the September 28 session below.

**Outstanding shared operational issue:** post-merge workflow run `36327362690` failed its live cross-school-isolation job with HTTP 503 / Cloudflare Error 1102 (Worker exceeded resource limits). Guardrails, certification matrix and Cloudflare build passed; dependent live-school certification was skipped. Do not report the full live audit as passing. K-State module completion means extraction parity plus the scoped live verification below, not fresh certification of every sport.
See `docs/KSTATE_MODULE.md` for the ownership inventory and test contract. K-State's existing school-specific backend policies are now in `src/schools/kstate.mjs`; generic publisher logic and shared catalog/display metadata remain shared.

Use the current main branch for new work, retaining the September 26 baseline branch target as the pre-extraction comparison/recovery reference.

## What was fixed and why it mattered

The September 4 Platte River Rumble Gold event had a saved, exact-event table built from the official recap. Its reliable results were not dependent on live AI generation.

For September 25 Gans Creek, the live feed selected only the women's result PDF, returning nine women and marking the result verified. The expanded view used a separate prose parser that could overwrite those rows with incorrect results. One observed response contained an incorrect men's team win and an athlete named `Junior Brock`; AI returned `ai_failed`. Generic TFRRS enrichment could also replace the original race's good table with malformed group labels and `0th` DNF/DNS rows.

The deployed K-State-only fix reads the exact official recap's labeled women's and men's team-finishes and individual-results sections. It extracts division/distance, K-State team placing/points, and each published athlete/place/time. Both the feed and expanded view use that same result path. Complete recap rows cannot be overwritten by a single PDF or AI/prose extraction. Incomplete or unavailable sections are explicitly marked partial. A matching future recap does not require a new hand-entered race record.

Official recap sources:

- https://www.kstatesports.com/news/2026/9/25/cross-country-wildcats-showcase-significant-personal-improvement-at-gans-creek-classic
- https://www.kstatesports.com/news/2026/9/4/cross-country-k-state-clinches-team-wins-at-platte-river-rumble-gold

### Verified live results (rechecked September 27)

| School / event | Women | Men | Team rows | Total rows |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| K-State — Gans Creek | 9 | 7 | 2 | 18 |
| K-State — Platte River Rumble Gold | 11 | 7 | 2 | 20 |

Gans Creek: women 18th / 499 points; men 17th / 449 points. The expanded live page displayed every runner, including the final listed women and men, with the expected names, places and times. Platte River's expanded live page retained the complete original table and highlights.

KU's live feed after the September 26 correction retained 26 Gans Creek rows and 21 Bob Timmons rows. Those KU live counts were not rechecked in this completion session. This is a scoped K-State/KU verification, not a claim that every sport at every school is currently correct.

### September 26 correction validation

- `npm run test:release` passed.
- `npm test` passed.
- `git diff --check` passed.
- Offline esbuild Worker bundle passed.
- Wrangler deployment dry-run passed after user approval.
- Actual downloaded K-State schedule/recap processed through production `fetchLive` and expanded-event code: 18/20 rows and matching feed/modal results.
- GitHub PR guardrails and certification-matrix jobs passed before merge (workflow run `36276099363`). Live-school jobs intentionally skipped for this PR.
- Remote correction tree matched the tested local tree exactly.
- Production status confirmed `4.24.1-kstate-recap-results`.
- Browser verification opened both K-State races and checked full result text and layout after deployment.
- Local regression protections covered the original K-State record, KU records, school/date identity, later matching recaps, incomplete/failed sources, 18 certified schools and 71 school/sport cache identities.

## School-module direction agreed with the user

The app should have one module per school, with sport handlers inside each school module as needed. School-specific source selection, schedule parsing, recap extraction and athlete verification belong there. Shared display, selection, refresh, caching and standardized event/result structures remain shared.

Separate files alone do not guarantee isolation. Test each module against that school's real publisher formats, and test shared changes against verified schools. Keep complete men's/women's result sections and source links in a consistent result format.

Agreed sequence:

1. **Completed:** preserve today's working version as the baseline.
2. **Completed:** K-State module extraction, approved merge/deployment, and scoped live cross-country verification.
3. A separate later session: bring KU's existing cross-country adapter into the school-module structure.
4. Correct and verify each remaining school individually, one school per new session.

The September 26 “Do the first one” applied to baseline preservation. The separate September 27 “Start KSTATE module” request authorized the extraction now prepared on its own branch.

## Instructions for the next session

- **Oklahoma State follow-ups (module is live):** official schedule fixtures other than women's Tennis; the women's cross country/track program; Cowboy Jamboree's 1-row result; deep recap certification; and a Track & Field empty-state response instead of the 502 "no usable events" (shared behavior). Otherwise, start the next school the user names.

- Next work: convert the next school the user names into its own module. Before or with the first conversion, consider defining a common school-module interface (schedule parser, recap matcher, results handlers, scoreboards, time zone). Shared code should then look up handlers by school instead of using `school.id==='kansas'` / `'kstate'` branches.
0. If the user approves, merge PR #19 (local-time fix; preview already verified), confirm CI, merge, and verify production `/api/status` returns `4.28.1-local-time`. Then check a forced K-State Basketball feed during an evening game if one is available. Until then, the fix is local/branch-only.
1. Read this file from current GitHub main and inspect the current source/version before editing.
2. KU and K-State are complete. Start no additional school until the user names it in a new school-module session; do not reopen PR #12 through #16.
3. Keep one school per session. After KU is complete, stop; wait for the user to name the next school in a new session.
4. Preserve K-State's 18/20 and KU's 26/21 XC rows. Keep all deterministic module, school and cache protections; run `npm run test:release` for code changes.
5. Do not claim all sports have finals where the school has not published results. KU tennis/softball/track source limitations are in `docs/KANSAS_MODULE.md`. Reviewed golf rows apply only to four exact unchanged articles.
6. Update this same handoff with actual publication/live evidence and append the session record. The previous cross-school resource-limit failure remains unresolved unless fresh evidence establishes otherwise.


## Publication and permission history

Automatic review initially blocked a Cloudflare dry-run and a GitHub push pending explicit publication approval. The user then approved pushing the fix to `egassam/SAS-Sports`, merging it, and deploying to the existing Cloudflare app. Publication and deployment subsequently succeeded.

Shell `git push` had no GitHub credentials. The connected GitHub tools successfully created the exact tested tree, commit, branch and PR. PR #11 was merged after checks passed. Cloudflare's existing GitHub integration deployed it; no separate direct deployment was needed.

The earlier `docs/KSTATE_CROSS_COUNTRY_CHECKPOINT.md` records pre-approval blockers. This current handoff supersedes that document's publication status. Prior approval was for the completed correction; it is not blanket authorization for unrelated future actions.

## Session conversation — September 26, 2026

This record preserves the user messages and substantive final assistant replies visible in this session. Progress/tool activity is summarized afterward; this is not a raw tool-log export or a reconstruction of earlier sessions.

### User — reported regression

> Now KSTATE cross country isn't working correctly. Only women show up in the new race.
> Figure out why everything works perfectly in the first KSTATE cross country event and repeat it. I believe you used AI to go into the official recap to get the results for our results page

### Assistant — diagnosis, implementation and approval request

I found the cause and fixed the code, **but it isn’t live yet**.

The first race uses a complete saved table from its official recap. The new race was reading only the women’s PDF; opening it then triggered another parser that produced incorrect results.

The fix reads both labeled sections directly from the recap, producing **nine women, seven men, and both team scores** in the first race’s format. Tests pass, including protection for the original event and KU.

Automatic approval review blocked both GitHub publication and the Cloudflare check because they send code externally.

**Approve pushing this fix to `egassam/SAS-Sports`, merging it, and deploying to your existing Cloudflare app?** I’ll then verify the live results page.

### User — approval

> Approve

### Assistant — verified completion

**Fixed and live.** I verified both expanded K-State results pages:

- **Gans Creek:** all nine women, seven men, and both team scores.
- **First race:** all 20 original result rows preserved.

[Open SAS Sports](https://sas-sports.lovetogivepain.workers.dev/?school=kstate) and tap **Refresh**.

A screenshot of the live results was included in the reply. Saved filename: `SAS_Sports_KState_Verified_Results_20260926.jpg`.

### User — school-module proposal

> This looks great now to me I think moving forward we should make corrections to each school making each school a single module? What do you think?

### Assistant — recommended architecture and sequence

**Yes. Each school should have its own module, with a shared core keeping SAS Sports consistent.** That would make school-specific corrections easier to contain and test.

I’d organize it this way:

| Part | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| **School module** | Official sources, schedule formats, recap extraction, and athlete verification for that school |
| **Sport handlers within it** | Cross-country tables, football scores, tennis results, and other sport-specific differences |
| **Shared core** | Display, school selection, refreshing, caching, and a standard results format |

Every school would deliver the same structured information to the app. For cross country, that means clearly labeled divisions, team scores, athlete names, places, times, and source links.

**Moving code into separate files alone won’t prevent regressions.** Each module also needs tests using that school’s actual official pages, plus checks that shared changes preserve working schools.

I recommend this sequence:

1. Preserve today’s working version as the baseline.
2. Move K-State’s working logic into its school module and verify identical output.
3. Bring KU’s existing cross-country module into that structure.
4. Correct and verify each remaining school individually.

That gives us a repeatable process: **fix one school, verify its results in the live app, then move on.**

### User — save baseline, conversation and session workflow

> Do the first one them we will saving the conversation into a .md file, then end this session. We will start a new session for each school module going forward. Each new session I want you to read the current .md file to begin the new section.

### Assistant — scope confirmation and completed handoff

The assistant explained that “the first one” means preserving today's working baseline, then saving this conversation and a current handoff file. A repository startup instruction was added to read this file before each future school-module session. No module migration was started.

### Progress and tool activity summary

The current repository, merged KU work, live feed, expanded-result API, and K-State's official recap pages were inspected. The women's-only feed and incorrect expanded results were reproduced. The scoped fix and meaningful regression tests were written and tested against actual source HTML. After approval, the exact tested tree was published through GitHub, merged, and deployed by the existing Cloudflare integration. Both K-State races were opened in the live browser; KU's feed was checked for preservation. The working application commit was then preserved on a named checkpoint branch, and this current handoff plus root startup instructions were saved. Application code was unchanged during the final baseline/documentation step.

## Future session records

Append each new school-module session here. Keep the current-state and next-session sections above accurate so the next session can begin without reconstructing the entire history.


### September 27, 2026 — save verification and completion

The user asked, "Did you finish before I ran out of usage?" The assistant initially could not verify the handoff save from conversation history. The user then instructed, "Confirm saving."

Direct GitHub inspection confirmed the recovery branch checkpoint/kstate-xc-verified-20260926 exists at 19ec2ecb2ac03b8c7d242cb14a23146878857ab0. The handoff and startup instructions existed in local documentation commit 9735515 but were absent from GitHub main. This session publishes those documentation files to finish the authorized save. The earlier wording that the handoff was saved referred to the local copy; the GitHub save was outstanding.

Scope clarification: the requested "first one" in the September 26 sequence was preserving the working baseline, which was completed. School-module migration was deliberately deferred to the next session. K-State remains the next module. This session changes documentation only; no new application tests or live verification were performed. The September 26 results above retain their original verification date.


### September 27, 2026 — K-State module implementation

User: “Start KSTATE module.” Earlier in the thread the user ended the save session; no module changes had been made at that point. This request begins the actual module implementation.

The current GitHub handoff and AGENTS.md were read before work. Main was fetched at `3ed968bda3ecef6bf6003b0663456e2beab7d383`; an isolated worktree/branch was created from that commit. The previous application baseline passed the release suite before extraction.

Implemented `src/schools/kstate.mjs`: six schedule overrides, three verified tennis identities, institutional social exclusion, five saved soccer recaps, original meet snapshot/highlights, and all K-State cross-country guards/parser/completeness/enrichment. Common publisher helpers, cache behavior, UI and shared metadata remain in their existing owners. Existing test harnesses now inject the real module. Added a permanent module test and frozen pre-refactor baseline fixture. Candidate version is `4.25.0-kstate-module`.

Validation actually completed:
- `npm run test:release` passed, including 18 protected schools and 71 critical school/sport cache identities, KU and K-State cross-country checks, and the new module test.
- `npm test` passed, including roster social identity checks.
- All ten K-State schedule/roster route outputs, five soccer enrichments and three verified tennis identities passed baseline checks; the tennis accounts were tested through the featured-athlete function with a deterministic roster fixture.
- Before/after comparison preserved 218 catalog school/sport schedule and roster route combinations and all saved game/social/source maps.
- Saved official K-State schedule/recap HTML replayed through production fetchLive and expanded results produced matching outputs (ignoring execution timestamps), including 18 Gans Creek rows and 20 Platte River rows.
- Offline esbuild bundle and actual bundled Worker import plus `/api/status` passed. Initial bundling used an older dependency directory missing unpdf; selecting the previous K-State checkout's complete installed dependencies resolved it without source/dependency changes.
- `git diff --check` passed.

Limitations and remaining tasks: no new live per-sport certification, browser verification, merge or deployment has been performed for this candidate. The recap parser still requires the official labeled sections and reports incomplete results explicitly. Complete K-State publication/live verification before moving to KU in a later session.


Publication checkpoint: draft PR https://github.com/egassam/SAS-Sports/pull/12 contains application commit `bb3f23124562ab496cc240a0a526e465d92e7f7d`. Its remote tree `e3273d03b3ada3d458bd099f2e2b2235767c727d` matched the tested local tree exactly. GitHub certification run `36327250369` completed successfully on that commit (PR checks; no live-school certification). The bundled HTTP feed and highlights endpoints were also replayed against the saved official HTML and returned identical 18/20 result rows. This documentation checkpoint adds the publication identifiers after those code checks. The PR is unmerged and the candidate is not deployed.


### September 27, 2026 — K-State module completion

User: “Complete KSTATE module.”

The current main handoff and AGENTS.md were read, and main was cloned at `30d6edd0f46f1ceebaed1fd7f5eca54921f0f095` with a clean working tree. The handoff was stale: PR #12 had already merged following the user's earlier approval, and Cloudflare had successfully built it. No application reimplementation, additional application changes or new application deployment was needed.

Validation actually completed in this session:
- `npm run test:release` and `npm test` both passed on the merged application.
- This includes all ten K-State source-route baseline checks, five saved soccer records, three verified tennis identities through the athlete path, KU/K-State result regressions, 18 protected schools and 71 cache identities.
- Production `/api/status` returned `4.25.0-kstate-module`.
- A forced-refresh K-State cross-country feed returned both teams and all 18/20 result rows.
- Both live expanded results were opened through the UI and inspected in full. Gans Creek showed 9 women, 7 men, 2 teams, 4 highlights and an official recap link; Platte River showed 11 women, 7 men, 2 teams, 4 highlights and an official recap link. The final listed runners and times were present. Screenshots confirmed readable grouped tables.
- A supplementary direct Python expanded-endpoint comparison received HTTP 403; it did not establish API parity or recheck KU. The successful live browser checks and forced feed are the live evidence for this session.
- Inspected merge check results: Cloudflare build, guardrails and certification matrix succeeded. Live cross-school-isolation job `108642654825`, run `36327362690`, failed at the firstBefore fetch (tests/isolation.mjs:74) after retries with HTTP 503 / Cloudflare resource limit Error 1102. Dependent live-school tests were skipped. This is unresolved; no claim that every school or sport passed live certification.
- Completion changes only this canonical Markdown handoff, preserving prior session history. KU is the next separate module session.

Publication history reconciliation: the previous session's user approved merging/deploying PR #12 after it was prepared. Merge completed at 14:50:17 UTC. The historical pre-approval records above are retained as history and are superseded by the current-state section.

### September 28, 2026 — finish KU module

User asked where SAS Sports work stood, then instructed: “Finish ku.” The assistant recovered GitHub main and read this current handoff plus AGENTS.md. Main did not contain the KU in-progress work described in conversation history, so the implementation started from `9f18a6c` on branch `refactor/kansas-school-module-20260928`.

Implemented the KU module and the fixes documented in `docs/KANSAS_MODULE.md`: selected schedule-payload parsing, 12 explicit sport routes, baseball restoration, corrected swimming source, both golf/basketball divisions, exact dates and doubleheaders, tournament end-date recap matching, preserved/future XC pipeline, and 22 reviewed individual golf placings with changed-fact protection. The Red Sky published total discrepancy is explained in the expanded view. No other school module was started.

Validation so far: initial baseline `npm run test:release` passed; candidate `npm run test:release`, `npm test`, the new Kansas module source-fixture suite, offline esbuild Worker bundle, and `git diff --check` passed. K-State 18/20 and KU 21/26 result protections passed; 18 protected schools and 71 cache identities passed. Official KU pages were downloaded on September 28 and tested against their current selected schedule data and 14 exact recap identities. The actual bundled Worker feed/highlight endpoints were replayed against downloaded official HTML for all 12 KU sports. All 207 non-KU sport source-route combinations and all verified social identities match the pre-change version. No new universal all-sport live certification is claimed.

Publication checkpoint: code/handoff are prepared locally. Commit/PR, deployment status and live checks will be recorded before ending this session. The user requests a stop after KU; do not continue to another school.


### September 28, 2026 — KU deployed verification and final recap correction

User: “Finish ku.” Read current main AGENTS.md and this entire handoff before work. Main was clean at `5d0ee5347e6258694d6b29bb03a499c57efeb321`. PR #13 had already merged; the historical publication checkpoint above was stale. No module reimplementation was needed.

Checks actually completed:
- Production `/api/status` returned `4.26.0-kansas-module`. Cloudflare merge build succeeded; PR run `36420513423` passed. Merged `npm run test:release` and `npm test` passed locally.
- Live KU feeds checked for all 12 sports: XC 2 finals/4 upcoming; soccer 11/9 and 1 other; volleyball 12/16; football 3/9; golf 4/22; swimming 0/13; rowing 0/9; baseball 0/38; basketball 0/70; softball 0/31 and 2 pending games; tennis 2 completed meets/6 upcoming without detailed results; track empty due to the prior-season source. Empty track is the documented source gap, not a passed current-results certification.
- Live expanded endpoints checked for all 34 listed completed events. XC feed/expanded rows match exactly (Gans Creek 26, Bob Timmons 21); all four golf events match exactly (7/6/6/7 rows, 22 individual placings). Both XC modals and Red Sky golf were visually checked in the browser, with complete division groups, highlights and recap links.
- Soccer 11, football 3, and 11 volleyball recaps returned verified highlights. Saint Louis and Tulsa soccer initially hit the existing eight-second AI timeout, then returned four highlights on individual retry. This is observed transient AI dependency, not a new reliability fix. Both tennis events correctly report that an exact recap was not found.
- One real defect remains in the deployed version: the September 11 South Dakota State volleyball schedule card links to the September 15 Wichita State recap. The actual correct KU article was retrieved. Prepared a KU-only exact school/sport/event ID/date/opponent/division/incorrect-URL repair. Corrected or later source links are not overridden; standard fetched-article identity verification still applies. No shared parser behavior changes. Version bump invalidates existing feed caches.
- All 12 athlete endpoints returned three named athletes with portrait URLs. Nine sports returned verified Instagram destinations; swimming, rowing and tennis use the existing official-profile fallback with null Instagram, introduced in earlier commit `d7f1d7e`. These are not newly verified Instagram accounts. No athlete policy changes were made.
- Live KU → Florida → KU stable comparison passed, and K-State feed retained 18/20 XC rows. Merge run `36420592088` failed its earlier cross-school comparison because KU IDs switched from old descriptive IDs to new official event IDs during rollout. This is consistent with a deployment race; it is not evidence of mixed-school records. The full 18-school live suite was not rerun, and the prior resource-limit issue is not claimed resolved.
- Initial Python urllib requests received HTTP 403 in this environment. Standard curl and the browser succeeded. No bypass or alternate network configuration was used.

Final correction publication/live verification is pending at this checkpoint. End the session after KU's correction and handoff save; do not start another school.

#### Final correction verification

PR #14 merged at 18:54:46 UTC (13:54:46 America/Chicago), producing merge commit `c9a02452107bad023ff06214f4ba99668f06d5a4`. GitHub post-merge certification run `36468538013` completed successfully. Production `/api/status` returned `4.26.1-kansas-recap`.

A forced live KU volleyball feed returned official event `20586` as South Dakota State, final 3-0, with the corrected September 11 KU recap URL. The live expanded endpoint then fetched that same official recap, identified it as an official athletics game recap, and returned four event-specific verified highlights naming Taylor Stanley, Reese Ptacek, Aisha Aiono, and Reese Messer. The incorrect Wichita State link is no longer returned for this event.

KU is complete. The session stops here without starting another school. The historical full-audit resource-limit limitation remains; this scoped completion does not claim a fresh universal certification of every school.

### September 28, 2026 — K-State dual teams and independent live scores

User opened a new K-State session with two items: show both teams for sports sponsored for men and women (Golf was the reported example), and replace dependence on the school page for live sports, with Football and men’s Basketball as the initial easy targets. The user asked for working changes to be implemented as the session progressed.

Diagnosis found that K-State Golf stopped after the first usable women’s page and had no division label. Basketball already loaded both programs. The Worker’s alternate scoreboard path existed only for Football and ran after official schedule retrieval. Historical ESPN scoreboards confirmed K-State identity `2306` for Football and men’s Basketball.

PR #15, https://github.com/egassam/SAS-Sports/pull/15, added K-State-specific combined-sport ownership and separate men’s/women’s schedule sources for Golf and Basketball. CI passed, the PR merged as `c4ab5faf5dbf369e367da761222bf96f370ed996`, and production deployed `4.27.0-kstate-dual-teams`. A forced production Golf feed then returned both `Women's` and `Men's` labels, with 4 results and 22 upcoming events. Basketball’s existing two-division behavior remained protected.

PR #16, https://github.com/egassam/SAS-Sports/pull/16, generalized the scoreboard parser/reconciler and configured K-State Football plus men’s and women’s Basketball ESPN scoreboard paths. Score retrieval begins independently of schedule parsing, uses a 15-second upstream cache, retains official schedule/recap fields, and replaces live/final state, scores, game detail and provenance. It appends the scoreboard event when no official schedule match exists. Basketball matching includes the division label so a men’s score cannot overwrite a women’s event. Other schools retain the pre-existing Football fallback.

Validation and publication actually completed:

- `npm run test:release`, `npm test`, `git diff --check`, and Wrangler deployment dry-run passed.
- The release suite preserved 18 protected schools, 71 critical school/sport cache identities, K-State XC 18/20 rows and KU XC 21/26 rows.
- Deterministic historical scoreboard fixtures verified K-State matching, a live 71-68 Basketball score, `2nd Half - 4:12`, source provenance, official-schedule reconciliation, and men’s/women’s isolation.
- PR #16 certification run `36511562983` passed. The tested local and remote tree SHA matched at `010538960efeec2776cdf5eaf37337aa3c4d1a7c`.
- PR #16 merged as application commit `a23a16b3b1d2a5fafec5327041953fcb4b672d43`; Cloudflare deployed production version `4.28.0-kstate-live-scores`.
- Forced production feeds returned Football with 4 results/8 upcoming and Basketball with 66 upcoming across both `Men's` and `Women's`, with no feed error. No K-State Football or Basketball game was live during this verification, so no claim is made that an actual in-progress contest was observed in this session.

Provider recommendation: the ESPN public scoreboard is the practical immediate source because it covers college Football and both Basketball programs without a key. It is not a contracted API. If SAS Sports later needs a formal SLA or redistribution terms, evaluate a licensed feed such as Sportradar or SportsDataIO. NCAA/Genius live-stat pages vary by event and are better treated as a supplemental fallback than the primary normalized feed.

Both requested K-State items are complete. The unresolved historical Cloudflare resource-limit issue still prevents a universal all-school live-audit claim; this session’s evidence is scoped to the tests and production feeds listed above.

### September 29, 2026 — K-State live display test

User: “Can we text the live feed so I can see it work on the app?” followed by “Test.” Treated “text” as “test” and checked production `/api/status` (`4.28.0-kstate-live-scores`) plus forced K-State Football, Basketball and Golf feeds. Football had 4 results/8 upcoming, Basketball had 66 upcoming across both divisions, and Golf had 4 results/22 upcoming across both divisions. None had a live event. The September 29 browser check confirmed the ordinary K-State page was serving its current schedule.

Added a K-State Basketball preview behind the explicit `demo=live` query parameter. Its sample card and panel both say DEMO, and the sample never enters the API or the ordinary URL. It advances from Upcoming to Live to Final automatically or with the button. The sample uses the existing card and count layout and does not impersonate an official event or attach an official source. PR #17 passed certification run `36568485438`, then merged as `a3ca8468a9dd29eeee78f896828990afaca7364e`; Cloudflare served the updated page. Local `npm run test:release`, inline script syntax and `git diff --check` passed. The production browser displayed the sample in Upcoming, Live (71–68, 2nd Half · 4:12), and Final states, and allowed replay.

An actual K-State in-progress ESPN → app transition remains unobserved because no game was live at test time. The earlier historical scoreboard fixtures continue to cover that data path deterministically. Keep the demo visibly marked and opt-in; do not count its sample as a real live game or a universal live-feed certification.

### September 29, 2026 — Football Live demo visibility correction

User supplied a phone screenshot showing K-State Football selected, the Live tab empty, and a 0 Live count. The initial demo had only activated for Basketball, and its automatic Final step could also leave Live empty. Corrected the opt-in preview to start and remain on Football's Live tab, with a labeled 28–21 sample and quarter; it also follows a switch to Basketball with a labeled 71–68 sample. The step button selects the corresponding tab when it moves through Final, Upcoming, and Live. The normal URL and backend feed still return only real events.

Local `npm run test:release`, inline JavaScript syntax and diff checks passed. PR #18 certification run `36570019605` passed; the PR merged as `304d3a7b011b0f5a9508cb9706f5f93181f644dd`. Cloudflare served the updated HTML. Production browser verification opened the demo URL on Football + Live, saw a 1 Live count and the labeled `3rd Quarter · 8:42` / 28–21 card, then switched to Basketball and saw its labeled `2nd Half · 4:12` / 71–68 card. Those are sample cards only. No actual in-progress game was available for live provider verification.

### September 29, 2026 — review suggestions and local-time fix

User asked for an analysis of the code and Markdown files. Assistant reported, among other suggestions: the ESPN/official date mismatch for evening games; the UTC "today" rollover; cold-cache and heavy-endpoint contributors to the Cloudflare 1102 failures; school-specific branches remaining in shared code; and stale handoff/README content. A script reproduced the evening-game defect against the current code: a 7 PM Central game produced a Live card dated January 18 plus a dropped official card.

User: “Yes, fix the time-zone bugs.” Implemented `schoolTimeZone`, `localWallClock`, `schoolNow` and `schoolToday` in `src/index.js`. `parseScoreboardPayload` now expresses ESPN UTC times in the school's local time and uses the Eastern calendar day when ESPN marks a time as unconfirmed (`timeValid:false`). `makeEvent`, `parseTextScheduleRows` and `groupEvents` compare against the school's local date. The KU module receives `schoolNow` for its future/past/tournament-in-progress checks (its default keeps old behavior if not injected). Version bumped to `4.28.1-local-time` so feed caches refresh.

Tests actually run:
- Baseline before changes: `npm run test:release` and `npm test` passed.
- After changes: both passed again, `git diff --check` passed, and an offline esbuild bundle passed.
- New K-State module assertions cover five cases: a 7 PM game still in Upcoming at 6:30 PM Central; ESPN 01:00Z mapped to 7 PM local; one reconciled Live card with the official ID; one Final result the next morning; and the calendar day kept for an unconfirmed ESPN time.
- The behavioral assertions were confirmed to fail on the previous code (“a 7 PM game stays upcoming at 6:30 PM Central”).

Publication: committed and pushed to `ccr-a8791a1a-rg8qi0` only. No PR, merge, deployment or live verification has been performed. This is a shared-code change affecting every school's day boundaries; the 18-school protection and 71 cache-identity checks passed locally. The Cloudflare 1102 issue remains unresolved.


#### Preview build follow-up

The branch push created PR #19 (https://github.com/egassam/SAS-Sports/pull/19), not yet merged. Cloudflare Workers Builds built the branch as a **preview**, not production. Its check reported success, and PR guardrails and certification-matrix passed. Production `/api/status` still returned `4.28.0-kstate-live-scores`, and main was unchanged at `37d5be3`.

The preview URL https://ccr-a8791a1a-rg8qi0-sas-sports.lovetogivepain.workers.dev returned `4.28.1-local-time`. Forced K-State feeds on the preview returned the following, with no feed error:
- Basketball: 66 upcoming across both divisions.
- Football: 4 results and 8 upcoming.
- Cross Country: Gans Creek 18 rows and Platte River 20 rows.

No live evening game was available, so the fixed reconciliation path has only fixture coverage so far. Merging PR #19 is what would deploy production.

#### Merge and production verification

User: “Yes, merge it and verify production.” PR #19 checks on head `6acb5ef` had passed (guardrails, certification-matrix, Cloudflare preview build). Merged as `79c157d8ce8349439cab3c23931d46f5fb920682`. Production `/api/status` returned `4.28.1-local-time` at 15:29 UTC.

Forced production feeds with no feed error:

| School | Sport | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| K-State | Football | 4 results / 8 upcoming |
| K-State | Basketball | 66 upcoming |
| K-State | Golf | 4 results / 22 upcoming |
| K-State | Cross Country | Gans Creek 18 rows, Platte River 20 rows |
| KU | Cross Country | Gans Creek 26 rows, Bob Timmons 21 rows |
| KU | Volleyball | 12 results / 16 upcoming |
| KU | Golf | 1 live / 4 results / 21 upcoming |
| Arizona | Football | 4 results / 9 upcoming |
| BYU | Football | 4 results / 17 upcoming |
| UCF | Football | 4 results / 15 upcoming |

KU Golf's live event is the Men's Windon Memorial Classic, Sept 28–29, correctly shown as "Tournament in progress" on its final day.

Post-merge run `36590082760`:
- guardrails and cross-school isolation smoke passed.
- 15 of 18 live school certifications passed; Oklahoma State, Utah and Alabama failed.
- Those same three schools also failed on the previous main run `36570340731`, before this change. Their failures are athlete checks ("athlete has no verified Instagram destination") unrelated to date handling. They remain an open, pre-existing issue.
- The K-State and KU CI jobs started around 15:28, possibly against the previous deployment. They were therefore rerun locally against `4.28.1-local-time`: all 8 feeds passed. K-State Cross Country initially returned a sandbox-side "fetch failed" twice while fetching the official site directly; it passed on retry with a 90-second timeout.

The 1102 resource-limit issue did not recur in this run, but it is not claimed resolved.

### September 29, 2026 — Oklahoma State module

Request (delivered as a scheduled session prompt): start the Oklahoma State module. Read AGENTS.md, this handoff and both finished module docs; build `src/schools/oklahoma-state.mjs` in the K-State/KU pattern; diagnose the Tennis/Equestrian/Track & Field "athlete has no verified Instagram destination" failures in runs `36590082760` and `36570340731` without inventing accounts; preserve K-State/KU; ask before PR, merge or deploy.

The assistant fetched main at `42a26c8`, read this file in full, and reported the handoff state and an Oklahoma State inventory before editing. After a later scheduled prompt said the user approved the plan, implementation proceeded locally using the recommended defaults: an opt-in fallback for Oklahoma State only, and no reuse of cross-country Instagram identities for Track & Field. That prompt came through the scheduler, not as a direct user message, so nothing was pushed or published.

Diagnosis:
- Job `109481412069` (run `36590082760`) showed 8/11 Oklahoma State rows passing. Tennis, Equestrian and Track & Field athletes failed.
- Live `/live/athletes` showed those sports returning the existing official-profile fallback (`instagram_url: null`, official okstate.com profile and portrait). The official `mxct` roster lists 55 men and publishes no Instagram links.
- The validator required Instagram for every returned athlete, so the fallback could never pass. It was not an app defect.
- Other defects found live: Track & Field displayed the six cross-country meets from the shared `mxct` schedule. Golf loaded only the women's page. Tennis returned `[]`: production `/api/diagnostic` showed women's 21 and men's 4 parsed events, but only the first source was used, and the season filter then removed everything.

Implemented (see `docs/OKLAHOMA_STATE_MODULE.md`):
- The new module owns routes for all 11 sports, `combinedSports` (Basketball, Golf, Tennis), the two verified cross-country identities, and the shared-schedule XC/track split.
- `src/index.js` holds no `oklahoma-state|` configuration. It gained one handler call in `parseHtml` and one `schoolCombinedSports` branch.
- `athlete_profile_fallback_sports` was added to the validator, the Oklahoma State manifest entry, `tests/README.md` and the protected-school guard. Equestrian and Track & Field minimums were added.
- Test harnesses now inject the new module.
- New test `tests/oklahoma-state-module.mjs`, with gzipped unmodified official roster fixtures (`mxct`, wrestling). Version bumped to `4.29.0-oklahoma-state-module`.

Tests actually run:
- Baseline before changes: `npm run test:release` and `npm test` passed.
- After changes: `npm run test:release` and `npm test` passed. This includes 18 protected schools, 71 cache identities, K-State XC 18/20, KU XC 21/26, both existing module suites and the new Oklahoma State suite. `git diff --check` passed.
- Wrangler `deploy --dry-run` bundle passed, and the bundled Worker's `/api/status` returned `4.29.0-oklahoma-state-module`. Nothing was uploaded.
- The new behavioral assertions were confirmed to fail with the split filter disabled ("Track & Field must not display cross-country meets") and with Golf/Tennis combination removed.
- Route parity: 219 catalog school/sport combinations dumped before and after. Only Oklahoma State Golf, Tennis and Soccer (unused fallback rosters) changed, and the verified-identity map is identical.
- Updated validator against production, athletes only: Oklahoma State 11/11 passed. Utah Volleyball and Alabama Soccer athletes still fail unchanged.

Limitations:
- okstate.com's bot protection returned HTTP 403 to the sandbox after the first burst of downloads. Retries were stopped rather than circumvented, so official schedule HTML fixtures are missing.
- Tennis/Golf orchestration is tested with minimal synthetic pages. The XC/track split uses the real meet names/dates as served by production.
- The women's program, Cowboy Jamboree result completeness and deep recap certification remain open.

Publication status: application commit `1a55077` on `oklahoma-state-module`. A later scheduled routine ("Oklahoma State: open PR when tests pass") authorized a push and PR but not a merge. Both suites were re-run and passed, main was unchanged at `42a26c8`, and the branch was pushed. PR #21 was opened. GitHub run `36599105600`: guardrails and certification-matrix passed; live-school jobs were skipped as usual for PRs. The Cloudflare Workers Builds preview deployed.

#### Preview verification and Tennis correction

- The preview `https://oklahoma-state-module-sas-sports.lovetogivepain.workers.dev` returned `4.29.0-oklahoma-state-module`.
- Forced OSU feeds:
  - Golf: `Men's` and `Women's`, 5 results and 24 upcoming.
  - Cross Country: 6 meets.
  - Track & Field: no cross-country meets. With no track meets published, the existing 502 "no usable events" response is returned.
  - Tennis: still empty.
- okstate.com briefly accepted one request. The official women's Tennis page is still the "2025-26 Cowgirl Tennis Schedule" (21 matches, January 23–April 12, 2026), and the men's events are also outside 2026–27. The earlier explanation, that only the first source was used, was incomplete. Loading both divisions is correct, but Tennis is empty because okstate.com has not published 2026–27 schedules. That page was added as a real fixture with a test.
- `validate-schools` against the preview: Oklahoma State 11/11 passed. Preview K-State XC 18/20 and KU XC 26/21 were unchanged.
- The docs/fixture follow-up commit was tested with `npm run test:release` and `npm test` before its push.
- Production remains `4.28.1-local-time` until the user approves merging PR #21.

#### Oklahoma State production verification

The user merged PR #21 at 17:31 UTC as `da5b91efa3647fed90dc0a1ef247db89f4d05992`. Verification ran from a separate session, and production `/api/status` returned `4.29.0-oklahoma-state-module` by 17:32 UTC.

Forced production feeds:

| School | Sport | HTTP | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Oklahoma State | Golf | 200 | `Men's` and `Women's`, 5 results / 24 upcoming |
| Oklahoma State | Cross Country | 200 | 2 results / 4 upcoming (Cowboy Preview 31 rows, Cowboy Jamboree 1 row) |
| Oklahoma State | Track & Field | 502 | "no usable events"; expected, no track meets published |
| Oklahoma State | Tennis | 200 | empty; okstate.com still lists 2025–26 matches |
| Oklahoma State | Football | 200 | 4 results / 8 upcoming |
| Oklahoma State | Soccer | 200 | 12 results / 13 upcoming |
| Oklahoma State | Wrestling | 200 | 17 upcoming |
| K-State | Cross Country | 200 | 18 / 20 rows, unchanged |
| KU | Cross Country | 200 | 26 / 21 rows, unchanged |
| K-State | Basketball | 200 | 66 upcoming across both divisions |

Certification:
- `validate-schools --schools=oklahoma-state,kstate,kansas` from merged main against production: 19/19 passed. That covers Oklahoma State 11/11, including Tennis, Equestrian and Track & Field athletes through the official-profile fallback, plus K-State 4/4 and KU 4/4.
- Post-merge run `36605569578`: guardrails, certification-matrix and cross-school isolation passed. 15 of 18 live schools passed, including Oklahoma State (previously failing).
- Utah and Alabama failed again, as in the previous two main runs; these schools are not yet converted.
- Colorado failed Soccer and Volleyball with HTTP 503, Cloudflare Error 1102 (Worker exceeded resource limits). That is the known open resource-limit issue, hit while caches were cold after the version bump, not a Colorado data change. A local rerun after the CI run passed Colorado 4/4.

Open: the Cloudflare 1102 resource-limit issue remains and recurred in this run. The Oklahoma State follow-ups listed in the next-session instructions remain.
